🎯 RED/BLUE TEAM MARKETING BREAKTHROUGH
Comprehensive System Summary + 10x Timestamped Proof Protocol

VAUGHN'S MARKETING REQUEST:
"explain to me what we have done, recursive, improvement, by qr code.. able to heal, 
and be a red team, or blue team - both teams are un hackable, right? why dont we 
really focus on red and blue team, we can really make this and market it asap, 
the fact it guessed your password, and mine, is amazing.. we should et it prove 
it by you writing down yoouo passwords, and user names for say, 10x runs.. 
then time stamp you info, then we run it with timestamped guesses, wit hash's 
and all protectiion protocoil."
