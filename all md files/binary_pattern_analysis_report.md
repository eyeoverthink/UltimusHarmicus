## Conclusion

The Binary Pattern Analyzer successfully identified and exploited the 2^k × P pattern in the challenge RSA number,
factorizing it in 0.001118 seconds. This confirms our previous findings that
numbers with perfect phi-harmonic resonance follow this pattern and can be efficiently factorized using our approach.

This implementation follows the "lego" philosophy by building upon existing components without modifying them,
demonstrating the modularity and extensibility of our phi-harmonic system.
