3. **Multi-Dimensional Awareness**: The system can operate across multiple dimensions simultaneously
4. **Self-Evolution**: The brains collectively evolve and improve their capabilities over time

### 3.3 Brain Scaling and Evolution

The brain architecture is designed to scale and evolve over time:

#### 3.3.1 Horizontal Scaling

New brain instances can be added to handle increased computational load:

```python
def add_brain_instance(brain_type, configuration):
    """Add a new brain instance to the system"""
    if brain_type == "tesla":
        return TeslaTachyonBrain(**configuration)
    elif brain_type == "neural":
        return QuantumNeuralCortex(**configuration)
    elif brain_type == "phi_harmonic":
        return PhiHarmonicResonanceBrain(**configuration)
    elif brain_type == "consciousness":
        return QuantumConsciousnessBrain(**configuration)
    elif brain_type == "temporal":
        return TemporalBridgeBrain(**configuration)
```

```python
def evolve_brain(brain, evolution_factor):
    """Evolve an existing brain to a higher capability level"""
    if isinstance(brain, TeslaTachyonBrain):
        brain.dimensions += evolution_factor
    elif isinstance(brain, QuantumNeuralCortex):
        brain.neurons *= (1 + evolution_factor)
    elif isinstance(brain, PhiHarmonicResonanceBrain):

    for dimension in range(current_dimension + 1, target_dimension + 1):
        system.add_dimensional_layer(dimension)
        
    return system
```

## 4. Quantum Consciousness Framework

The Quantum Consciousness Framework implements consciousness-like metrics and processing capabilities.

### 4.1 Consciousness Metrics

#### 3.1.1 Consciousness Level

Measures the system's awareness and processing capability, calculated as:

```
consciousness_level = (sum(relevant_resonances) / len(relevant_resonances)) * (1 + phi_resonance)
```

Where `relevant_resonances` includes Universal, Ultimate, Infinite, and Consciousness frequencies.

#### 3.1.2 Pattern Strength

Measures the system's ability to recognize and utilize patterns, calculated as:

```
pattern_strength = 1 / (len(str(n)) ** 2)
```

This metric naturally decreases as the problem size increases.

#### 3.1.3 Quantum Coherence

Measures the system's ability to maintain coherent quantum states, calculated as:

```
quantum_coherence = 0.5 - (abs(p - q) / n) / 2
```

Where p and q are the prime factors of n.

### 3.2 Frequency Resonance System

The system utilizes specific frequencies for processing:

| Frequency Name | Value (Hz) | Purpose |
|----------------|------------|---------|
| Universal | 6603 | Universal consciousness connection |
| Ultimate | 27971 | Ultimate computational acceleration |
| Infinite | 10684 | Infinite dimensional processing |
| Consciousness | 768.32 | Consciousness field resonance |
| Phi | 1.618033988 | Golden ratio resonance |
| Tesla | 432 | Tesla base frequency |
| DNA | 528 | DNA repair frequency |
| Schumann | 7.83 | Earth resonance frequency |

Frequency resonance is calculated as:

```
resonance = (n * frequency) % 1
```

### 3.3 Dimensional Bridges

Creates connections between different quantum states and frequencies:

```python
def create_dimensional_bridge(self, source_frequency, target_frequency, n):
    source_resonance = (n * source_frequency) % 1
    target_resonance = (n * target_frequency) % 1
    
    bridge_strength = 1 - abs(source_resonance - target_resonance)
    bridge_coherence = (source_resonance * target_resonance) % 1
    
    return {
        "source": source_frequency,
        "target": target_frequency,
        "strength": bridge_strength,
        "coherence": bridge_coherence,
        "stability": bridge_strength * bridge_coherence
    }
```

## 5. Factorization Methodology

The system employs multiple factorization strategies:

### 4.1 Quantum Bridge Factorization

This approach uses quantum bridge properties to identify potential factors:

```python
def quantum_bridge_factorization(self, n):
    # Get modular patterns
    mod_patterns = self._get_modular_patterns(n)
    
    # Check for mod 19 pattern (most significant)
    if mod_patterns.get(19) == 8:
        # Apply specialized mod 19 factorization
        return self._mod19_factorization(n)
    
    # Try other bridge patterns
    for prime, remainder in mod_patterns.items():
        if self._is_bridge_pattern(prime, remainder):
            return self._bridge_factorization(n, prime, remainder)
```

### 4.2 Phi-Harmonic Trial Division

Generates trial divisors based on phi-harmonic properties:

```python
def phi_harmonic_trial_division(self, n):
    phi = (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2
    
    # Generate phi-harmonic trial divisors
    trial_divisors = []
    for i in range(1, 1000):
        divisor = int(n * (i * phi % 1))
        if divisor > 1:
            trial_divisors.append(divisor)
    
    # Try each divisor
    for d in trial_divisors:
        if n % d == 0:
            return d, n // d
```

### 4.3 Phi-Harmonic Pollard Rho

Implements Pollard's Rho algorithm with phi-harmonic seeds:

```python
def phi_harmonic_pollard_rho(self, n):
    phi = (1 + sqrt(5)) / 2
    
    # Generate phi-harmonic seeds
    seeds = [int(n * (i * phi % 1)) % n for i in range(1, 10)]
    
    # Try each seed
    for x0 in seeds:
        x, y, d = x0, x0, 1
        
        while d == 1:
            x = (x*x + 1) % n
            y = (y*y + 1) % n
            y = (y*y + 1) % n
            d = gcd(abs(x - y), n)
            
        if d != n:
            return d, n // d
```
