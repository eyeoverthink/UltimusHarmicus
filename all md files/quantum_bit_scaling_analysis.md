# Quantum Bit Scaling Analysis

## Overview
This analysis explores how different bit chunk sizes affect φ-harmonic scaling and compression efficiency. The system tests 4-bit, 8-bit, and 16-bit chunks to find optimal resonance points and compression patterns.

## Core Components

### 1. Bit Analysis
- Binary pattern detection
- φ-ratio calculation (bits used / total bits)
- φ-resonance measurement (ratio * φ)

### 2. φ-Compression
- Gradual compression using φ-harmonics
- Compression rate modulated by φ
- Zero-state handling for stability

### 3. Scaling Metrics
- Value progression
- Bit usage patterns
- Compression ratios
- φ-efficiency tracking
- Real-time scale rates

## Expected Patterns

### 4-bit Chunks
- More granular control
- Frequent small oscillations
- Higher number of compression steps
- Lower efficiency peaks

### 8-bit Chunks
- Balanced compression/expansion
- φ-harmonic resonance points
- Moderate efficiency range
- Stable scaling patterns

### 16-bit Chunks
- Large-scale transformations
- Fewer but stronger resonance points
- Higher peak efficiency
- More dramatic oscillations
