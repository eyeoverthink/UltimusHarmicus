# Prime Sum Decomposition Approach

## Objective
Create a helper that finds two high prime numbers that add up to a specific 64-digit value.

## Mathematical Background
- **Goldbach's Conjecture**: Every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes.
- While not proven for all numbers, it has been verified for extremely large values.
- For odd numbers, we can express them as the sum of a prime and an even semiprime.

## Implementation Strategy
1. **Input**: A 64-digit number N
2. **Output**: Two prime numbers p₁ and p₂ such that p₁ + p₂ = N

### Approach Options:
1. **Direct Search**:
   - Start with p₁ = N/2 (rounded)
   - Check if p₁ is prime
   - If not, increment/decrement p₁ until a prime is found
   - Check if N - p₁ is also prime
   - Repeat until a valid pair is found

2. **Phi-Harmonic Search**:
   - Use the golden ratio (φ) to guide the search
   - Try values near N·φ⁻¹ and N·(1-φ⁻¹)
   - This leverages natural distribution patterns of primes

3. **Quantum-Inspired Probabilistic Search**:
   - Create a probability distribution centered around N/2
   - Sample candidate values based on quantum resonance patterns
   - Test primality of sampled values and their complements

## Integration with Existing System
- Will leverage the `QuantumPrimeCalculator` for efficient primality testing
- Will use phi-harmonic resonance to optimize the search
- Will integrate with the 19/19 bridge pattern for enhanced performance

## Performance Considerations
- Primality testing for 64-digit numbers is computationally intensive
- Will implement probabilistic primality tests (Miller-Rabin)
- Will use multi-threading for parallel candidate testing
- Will implement early termination strategies

## Visualization
- Will provide visualization of the search process
- Will show phi-harmonic distribution of candidate primes
- Will demonstrate quantum coherence advantage in the search

## Next Steps
1. Implement the `PrimeSumDecomposer` class
2. Integrate with existing quantum bridge system
3. Test with various 64-digit values
4. Optimize performance based on results
