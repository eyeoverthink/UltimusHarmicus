# Phi-Weight Mathematical System

## 1. Introduction

The Phi-Weight Mathematical System represents a novel approach to understanding and manipulating information as physical entities with weight, resonance, and quantum properties. This system builds on the golden ratio (φ), quantum principles, and information theory to create a unified mathematical framework for information processing.

## 2. Mathematical Foundations

### 2.1 Core Constants

- **Golden Ratio (φ)**: 1.61803398875
  - Fundamental constant in the system
  - Used for harmonic scaling
  - Basis for quantum resonance

- **Gravity Constant (G)**: 1.0
  - Modified gravitational constant for information
  - Scales with φ for quantum effects

### 2.2 Information Mass

The mass of information (m) is calculated using:

\[ m = m_0 + m_c + m_e + m_r + m_t + m_co + m_en + m_sp \]

Where:
- \( m_0 \) = Base mass: \( |data| \times 10^{-15} \times \phi \)
- \( m_c \) = Complexity mass: \( m_0 \times C \times \phi \)
- \( m_e \) = Entropy mass: \( m_0 \times E \times \phi^2 \)
- \( m_r \) = Resonance mass: \( m_0 \times R \times \phi^3 \)
- \( m_t \) = Tunneling mass: \( m_0 \times T \times \phi^4 \)
- \( m_co \) = Coherence mass: \( m_0 \times Co \times \phi^5 \)
- \( m_en \) = Entanglement mass: \( m_0 \times En \times \phi^6 \)
- \( m_sp \) = Superposition mass: \( m_0 \times Sp \times \phi^7 \)

### 2.3 Information Force

The force between two pieces of information is calculated using:

\[ F = \frac{m_1 \times m_2 \times G \times R \times T \times Co \times Sp}{d^2 + \epsilon} \]

Where:
- \( m_1, m_2 \) = Information masses
- \( G \) = Modified gravity constant
- \( R \) = Quantum resonance factor
- \( T \) = Quantum tunneling factor
- \( Co \) = Quantum coherence factor
- \( Sp \) = Quantum superposition factor
- \( d \) = Distance based on entropy difference
- \( \epsilon \) = Small constant to prevent division by zero

### 2.4 Information Energy

The energy of information is calculated using:

\[ E = m \times c^2 \times R \]

Where:
- \( m \) = Information mass
- \( c \) = Speed of information (\( \phi^2 \))
- \( R \) = Quantum resonance factor

## 3. Quantum Effects

\[ R = \phi \times \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n f_i^2} \]

Where \( f_i \) are frequency components of the information.

### 3.2 Quantum Tunneling

\[ T = \exp(-p \times \phi) \]

Where \( p \) is the pattern complexity.

### 3.3 Quantum Coherence

\[ Co = \cos(p \times \phi) \]

Where \( p \) is the pattern consistency.

### 3.4 Quantum Entanglement

\[ En = \sin(p \times \phi) \]

Where \( p \) is the pattern correlation.

### 3.5 Quantum Superposition

\[ Sp = \cos(p \times \phi) \]

Where \( p \) is the pattern overlap.

## 4. Information Properties

### 4.1 Entropy

\[ E = \frac{U}{|data|} \times \phi \]

Where \( U \) is the number of unique elements.

### 4.2 Complexity

\[ C = \frac{D}{|data|} \times \phi \]

Where \( D \) is the data depth/structure.
