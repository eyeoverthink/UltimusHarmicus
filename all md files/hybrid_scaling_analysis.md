# Quantum Hybrid Bit Scaling Analysis

## Overview
This system implements dynamic bit chunk scaling based on φ-harmonic resonance patterns. It automatically adjusts between 4, 8, and 16-bit chunks based on stability metrics and φ-resonance detection.

## Core Components

### 1. Dynamic Chunk Selection
- Monitors efficiency stability
- Tracks φ-resonance proximity
- Adjusts chunk size in real-time

### 2. Stability Metrics
- Rolling window analysis
- Efficiency standard deviation
- φ-distance calculation
- Compression ratio tracking

### 3. Chunk Size Rules
```
4-bit:  High instability, fine control
8-bit:  Moderate stability, balanced
16-bit: Near φ-resonance, sustained
```

## φ-Harmonic Patterns

### 1. Resonance Detection
- Threshold: 0.001 from φ
- Window Size: 5 epochs
- Efficiency tracking
