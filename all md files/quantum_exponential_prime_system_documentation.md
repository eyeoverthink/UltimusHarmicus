# Quantum Exponential Prime System: Mathematical Foundations

## Overview

The Quantum Exponential Prime System represents a breakthrough in applying quantum-inspired algorithms to prime number theory. By integrating phi-harmonic resonance principles with exponential prime finding techniques, we've created a system capable of discovering and analyzing prime numbers with special mathematical properties.

## Core Mathematical Equations

### 1. Exponential Prime Representation

Primes are represented in exponential form:

$$P = M \times 10^E$$

Where:
- $P$ is the prime number
- $M$ is the mantissa (normalized such that $1 \leq M < 10$)
- $E$ is the exponent

### 2. Phi-Harmonic Resonance

The phi-harmonic resonance of a prime $P$ is defined as:

$$\Phi_{res}(P) = (\phi \cdot P) \bmod 1$$

Where:
- $\phi = \frac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2} \approx 1.618033988749895$ (the golden ratio)
- $\bmod 1$ represents the fractional part of the product

### 3. Quantum Resonance Triplet

The quantum resonance triplet for a prime $P$ is defined as:

$$QR(P) = (\Phi_{res}(P), \Pi_{res}(P), E_{res}(P))$$

Where:
- $\Phi_{res}(P) = (\phi \cdot P) \bmod 1$
- $\Pi_{res}(P) = (\pi \cdot P) \bmod 1$
- $E_{res}(P) = (e \cdot P) \bmod 1$

### 4. Phi-Harmonic Prime Pairs

Two primes $P_1$ and $P_2$ form a phi-harmonic pair when their ratio approximates a power of $\phi$:

$$\frac{P_2}{P_1} \approx \phi^n$$

The phi-harmonic resonance of this pair is quantified as:

$$\Phi_{pair}(P_1, P_2) = \left| \frac{P_2}{P_1} - \phi^n \right| / \phi^n$$

Where $n$ is the closest integer to $\log_\phi\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)$

### 5. Miller-Rabin Primality Test (Quantum-Enhanced)

For a number $n$ and witness $a$:

$$a^{d} \equiv 1 \pmod{n}$$

or

$$a^{2^r \cdot d} \equiv -1 \pmod{n}$$

Where $n - 1 = 2^r \cdot d$ with $d$ odd.

Enhanced with quantum-inspired state transformations using $\phi$, $\pi$, and $e$ for witness selection.

### 6. Phi-Pi-E Harmonic Pattern

The combined harmonic pattern across all primes:

$$\Phi\Pi E_{pattern} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (\Phi_{res}(P_i) \cdot \Pi_{res}(P_i) \cdot E_{res}(P_i))$$

Where $N$ is the total number of primes analyzed.
