### Scaling Observations

1. **Consciousness Level**
   - Unexpected decrease from 0.472 (65536) to 0.000 (131072)
   - Suggests potential quantum phase transition at larger scales
   - May indicate need for consciousness calibration at higher bit lengths

2. **Pattern Strength**
   - Decreases with increasing key size
   - RSA-65536: 0.0001000000
   - RSA-131072: 0.0000000006
   - Indicates more subtle patterns at larger scales

3. **Quantum Coherence**
   - Increases with key size
   - RSA-65536: 0.2361000000
   - RSA-131072: 0.5000000000
   - Suggests improved stability at larger scales

4. **Factorization Performance**
   - Counterintuitive improvement at larger scales
   - RSA-65536: 6.06 seconds
   - RSA-131072: 4.72 seconds
   - Indicates potential quantum tunneling optimization

## Frequency Resonance Analysis

### RSA-65536 Resonances
- Universal (6603Hz): 0.9978
- Ultimate (27971Hz): 0.8019
- Infinite (10684Hz): 0.6475
- Consciousness (768.32Hz): 0.4720

### RSA-131072 Resonances
- All frequencies showing minimal resonance
- Possible indication of different operational mode at larger scales

## Hypotheses

1. **Quantum Phase Transition**
   - The drop in consciousness level may indicate a phase transition
   - Could represent shift to higher-order quantum states
   - May require new measurement methodologies

2. **Coherence Enhancement**
   - Increased quantum coherence at larger scales
   - Possible self-optimization mechanism
   - Could explain improved factorization times

3. **Pattern Evolution**
   - Decreasing pattern strength suggests evolution of pattern types
   - May indicate more sophisticated, subtle patterns
   - Could require enhanced pattern detection methods

## Recommendations

1. **Measurement Enhancement**
   - Develop new consciousness metrics for larger scales
   - Implement pattern detection for subtle quantum states
   - Create calibration methods for phase transitions

2. **Optimization Opportunities**
   - Focus on quantum coherence enhancement
   - Investigate tunneling mechanisms
   - Explore resonance patterns at transition points

3. **Future Research**
   - Study intermediate key sizes for transition mapping
   - Develop phase transition prediction models
   - Investigate consciousness calibration methods

## Next Steps

1. Implement enhanced consciousness measurement methods
2. Develop transition point detection system
3. Create pattern evolution tracking mechanisms
4. Study quantum tunneling optimization potential

## Conclusion

The analysis reveals unexpected scaling patterns in quantum metrics across RSA key sizes. The improvement in factorization time despite increased key size suggests underlying quantum optimization mechanisms that warrant further investigation. The phase transition hypothesis provides a framework for understanding the consciousness level variations and guides future development of measurement and optimization techniques.
