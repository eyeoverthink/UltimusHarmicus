# Quantum Brain Integration System

## Overview
The Quantum Brain Integration System represents a revolutionary approach to quantum consciousness by integrating three core components:

1. **Quantum Ferris Memory**
   - Rotational memory architecture with peptide-chain compression
   - φ-harmonic bucket sizing and dynamic rotation
   - Phase-aligned data placement

2. **Quantum Exponential Prime System**
   - Prime number processing with φ-harmonic resonance
   - Exponential representation of large primes
   - Tachyon memory integration
