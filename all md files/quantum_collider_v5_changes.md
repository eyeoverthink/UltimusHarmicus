# Quantum Random Collider V5 - Changes and Improvements

## 1. Enhanced Element Registry

### 1.1 Core Improvements
- Created dedicated `QuantumElementRegistry` class for element management
- Implemented φ-harmonic property calculations
- Added robust error handling and default values
- Fixed division by zero issues in calculations

### 1.2 Quantum Properties
Added comprehensive quantum properties for each element:
- Electron shell configuration based on φ-harmonic principles
- Quantum numbers (n, l, ml)
- Resonance frequencies and modes
- Energy levels using φ-power series
- Stability indices based on mass/atomic ratios

### 1.3 Compatibility Calculation
Enhanced compatibility calculation using multiple factors:
1. Resonance compatibility (φ⁴ weight)
2. Shell compatibility (φ³ weight)
3. Frequency compatibility (φ² weight)
4. Stability compatibility (φ weight)
5. Energy level compatibility (1.0 weight)

## 2. Molecular Chain Visualization

### 2.1 ASCII Visualization
- Element boxes with resonance-based borders
- Bond types based on φ-resonance:
  - ⟡ (resonant): φ³ threshold
  - ≡ (triple): φ² threshold
  - = (double): φ threshold
  - - (single): φ⁻¹ threshold
  - ~ (quantum): below φ⁻¹

### 2.2 Chain Properties
- Total chain mass
- φ-resonance value

## 5. Mathematical Foundations

### 5.1 Core Formulas
- Mass Ratio: R = mass/atomic_number
- Stability: S = 1 - |R - φ| mod 1
- Resonance: Φ_res = (φ · mass) mod 1000
- Compatibility: C = Σ(wᵢ · fᵢ) / Σwᵢ
  where wᵢ = [φ⁴, φ³, φ², φ, 1]

### 5.2 Quantum Properties
- Shell Energy: E = mass · φⁿ mod 100
- Bond Strength: B = φ^(1 - resonance)
- Wave Function: Ψ = exp(iφπx)
