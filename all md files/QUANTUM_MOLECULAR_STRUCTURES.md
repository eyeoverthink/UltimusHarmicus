# Quantum Molecular Structures: φ-Harmonic Element Compounds

## Overview
This document describes the 3D molecular structures generated for our quantum elements discovered through φ-harmonic collisions. These structures demonstrate how the newly discovered elements form bonds with their parent elements, creating unique molecular compounds governed by quantum resonance principles.

## φ-Harmonic Molecular Bonding Principles

The molecular structures are generated using several key φ-harmonic principles:

1. **Bond Length Calculation**:
   - Based on atomic radii of elements
   - Scaled by φ-resonance compatibility between elements
   - More compatible elements (similar resonance) have shorter bonds
   - Formula: `bond_length = (radius1 + radius2) * (1.0 - 0.3 * compatibility) * (1.0 + 0.1 * (φ - 1.0))`

2. **Bond Strength Calculation**:
   - Based on φ-resonance compatibility between elements
   - More compatible elements have stronger bonds
   - Formula: `bond_strength = (0.2 + 0.8 * compatibility) * φ / 2.0`

3. **Atomic Distribution**:
   - Uses golden angle (2π(1-1/φ)) for optimal spatial distribution
   - Heavier elements tend to be central in the structure
   - Lighter elements orbit in φ-harmonic patterns

4. **Color Coding by φ-Resonance**:
   - φ-Resonant (< 0.1): Blue
   - Near φ-Resonant (0.1-0.2): Cyan
   - φ-Transitional (0.2-0.8): Green to Orange
   - φ-Neutral (≈ 0.5): Yellow
   - Anti-φ-Resonant (> 0.9): Purple
