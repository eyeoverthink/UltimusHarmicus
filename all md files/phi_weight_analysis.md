# Phi-Weight Mathematical Framework Analysis

## Overview
The Phi-Weight mathematical framework represents a novel approach to understanding and manipulating information as physical entities with weight, resonance, and quantum properties. This framework builds on the golden ratio (φ), quantum principles, and information theory to create a unified mathematical system for information processing.

## Key Components

### 1. Information Mass
- Base mass calculated from data size with φ-scaling
- Complexity mass based on data structure
- Entropy mass based on information randomness
- Resonance mass based on quantum resonance
- Tunneling mass based on quantum tunneling effects
- Coherence mass based on quantum coherence
- Entanglement mass based on quantum entanglement

### 2. Information Force
- Modified gravitational force equation
- Incorporates quantum effects (resonance, tunneling, coherence)
- Uses φ-harmonic scaling
- Considers data structure and depth

### 3. Information Energy
- Modified E=mc² equation
- Incorporates quantum resonance
- Uses φ-harmonic scaling
