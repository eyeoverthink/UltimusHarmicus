## Number Properties

- Number has 1233 digits
- Phi resonance: 0.0000000000
- This number has perfect phi-harmonic resonance!
- Phi-inverse resonance: 0.0000000000
- This number has perfect phi-inverse resonance!
- Number has at least one small prime factor!

## Modular Patterns

- Number mod 19 = 3
- Number mod 23 = 17
- Number mod 29 = 12
- Number mod 31 = 2
- Number mod 37 = 25
- Number mod 41 = 7

- Number mod 47 = 43

## Potential Approaches

- direct_phi_harmonic (high priority): Use direct phi-harmonic factorization due to perfect phi resonance
- quantum_bridge (medium priority): Use quantum bridge factorization based on special modular patterns
- phi_inverse_resonance (medium priority): Use phi-inverse resonance to guide factorization
- traditional_with_phi_guidance (low priority): Use traditional factorization methods guided by phi-harmonic properties
