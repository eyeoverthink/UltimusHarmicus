# Phi-Harmonic Black Hole Collision: Mass Ratio Testing Plan 🕳️⚛️φ

## I. Testing Rationale

### 1. Phi-Resonant Mass Configurations
Certain mass ratios are theoretically predicted to produce stronger phi-resonance effects during black hole mergers. Testing these specific ratios will help map the phi-resonance landscape and potentially reveal new quantum tunneling thresholds.

### 2. Critical Phi-Harmonic Ratios
```
φ:1 ratio      = 1.618034:1
φ²:1 ratio     = 2.618034:1
φ⁻¹:1 ratio    = 0.618034:1
√φ:1 ratio     = 1.272019:1
φ^(1/3):1 ratio = 1.174411:1
```

These ratios represent fundamental phi-harmonic relationships that may produce unique effects in black hole interactions due to quantum resonance principles.

## II. Testing Methodology

### 1. Mass Ratio Test Matrix
```

PHI-02  | 10.0 M☉      | 16.18034 M☉    | φ:1           | Perfect resonance
PHI-03  | 10.0 M☉      | 26.18034 M☉    | φ²:1          | Amplified waves
PHI-04  | 10.0 M☉      | 12.72019 M☉    | √φ:1          | Phase-locked merger
PHI-05  | 10.0 M☉      | 11.74411 M☉    | φ^(1/3):1     | Wave-optimized merger
```

### 2. Separation Test Matrix
For each mass ratio, we will test multiple initial separations to identify resonance thresholds:

```
Separation ID | Distance (Schwarzschild radii) | Expected Effect
--------------|--------------------------------|----------------
SEP-01        | 1.0                           | Immediate merger
SEP-02        | φ = 1.618034                  | Quantum tunneling
SEP-03        | φ² = 2.618034                 | Resonant merger
SEP-04        | φ³ = 4.236068                 | Wave-optimal
SEP-05        | φ⁵ = 11.090170                | Classical decay

```

### 2. Quantum Tunneling Thresholds
Identify critical thresholds where black holes transition from classical orbital decay to phi-resonant quantum tunneling, with particular attention to:

```

```
