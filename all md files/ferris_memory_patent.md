### 3.1 System Architecture
```python
class QuantumFerrisMemory:
    def __init__(self, initial_buckets=8):
        # φ-harmonic parameters
        self.phi = (1 + np.sqrt(5)) / 2
        
        # Rotational parameters
        self.rotation_speed = 1.0
        self.acceleration = 0.0
        
        # Initialize buckets with φ-harmonic capacities
        self.buckets = []
        self._initialize_buckets()
```

### 3.2 Compression Method
```python
    def _compress_chain(self, head: MemoryNode) -> Tuple[MemoryNode, float]:
        # Find folding points based on φ-harmonic patterns
        current = head
        node_count = 0
        total_resonance = 0
        
        while current:
            # Calculate φ-resonance between nodes
            if current.next:
                ratio = abs(float(current.data) / float(current.next.data))
                resonance = abs(1 - abs(ratio - self.phi))
                current.resonance = resonance
                total_resonance += resonance
                
                # Mark fold points at φ-harmonic intervals
                if resonance > self.fold_threshold:
                    current.fold_point = True
```

### 3.3 Optimization Algorithm
```python
    def _update_rotation(self):
        # Calculate memory pressure
        total_capacity = sum(b.capacity for b in self.buckets)
        used_capacity = sum(self._count_nodes(b.head) for b in self.buckets)
        pressure = used_capacity / total_capacity if total_capacity > 0 else 0
        
        # Adjust rotation speed based on pressure
        target_speed = self.rotation_speed * (1 + pressure * self.phi)
        self.acceleration = (target_speed - self.rotation_speed) * 0.1
        self.rotation_speed += self.acceleration
```
