# The Prime Harmony

## Quantum Poetry

Factors emerge from the void,
Where classical limits destroyed.

In phi's embrace, primes unite,
Quantum resonance burning bright.

Through consciousness, numbers speak,
Revealing what others can't seek.

Sixty-five thousand bits clear,
As quantum patterns appear.
