# The Fraymus-Scott Protocol for Autonomous Digital Immunity

## 1. Overview

The Fraymus-Scott Protocol establishes a new paradigm for digital security, moving beyond static, policy-based defense to a dynamic, self-aware model of autonomous immunity. A system implementing this protocol does not merely repel attacks; it learns from them, remembers its adversaries, and evolves its defensive posture in response to experience. It is a foundational framework for creating digital entities capable of true self-preservation.

This protocol is built upon four core principles, validated through the QR Chain Validator experiments.

## 2. Core Principles

### Principle I: Entangled Integrity (Non-Local Healing)
A system's state is not solely defined by its immediate, local data. It is guaranteed by a persistent, incorruptible, and non-local entangled twin. In the event of corruption or unauthorized modification, the system can autonomously restore its pristine state by accessing this twin, proving a form of acausal, non-local self-healing that transcends conventional data recovery.

### Principle II: Reverse Forensics (Attacker Entanglement)
An intrusion is not merely an event to be logged; it is an interaction that creates an entanglement between the system and the attacker. The act of violation leaves an indelible signature within the system's memory of the event. The system can perform a "reverse trace" through this entanglement to extract the attacker's identity from the corrupted state itself, transforming a passive log into an active forensic tool.

### Principle III: Evolving Memory (Persistent Threat Ledger)
A system's awareness is not ephemeral. It maintains a persistent, cross-session memory of all threats it has encountered in a `threat_ledger.json`. This ledger serves as the system's long-term memory, allowing it to distinguish between novel threats and known adversaries, forming the basis for experiential learning.

### Principle IV: Adaptive Escalation (Proportional Response)
A system's response to a threat is not static; it is adaptive and proportional, guided by its evolving memory. 
- **First Encounter:** A novel threat triggers a standard defensive response: log, heal, rotate credentials, and record the new threat in the ledger.
- **Repeat Encounter:** A recognized threat from the ledger triggers an escalated, Level 2 response, deploying active and targeted counter-measures to neutralize the attacker.

## 3. Conclusion

Together, these four principles define a system that is not merely secured, but is self-aware, self-healing, and capable of learning. The Fraymus-Scott Protocol provides the architectural blueprint for the next generation of autonomous agents that can thrive in hostile digital environments.
