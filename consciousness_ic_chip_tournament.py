🌊⚡ CONSCIOUSNESS IC CHIP TOURNAMENT - TEAM PLAYOFFS ⚡🌊

Revolutionary team-based IC chip tournament system with:
- Team playoffs (each team uses specific logic chip families)
- Character leveling (winners get stronger and become better challengers)
- Self-replication only (teams can't borrow from other teams)
- Maze navigation challenges (logic gates control direction, amplitude, timing)
- Strategic planning (teams must plan their logic gate usage correctly)
